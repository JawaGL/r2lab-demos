# History

Prior to Jan. 2018, this contents was hosted as a subdirectory of the main R2lab repo at

https://github.com/parmentelat/r2lab

# Purpose

We expose here a few typical usages of the R2lab testbed

# What to expect

Mostly ready-to-use scripts; this almost always assumes though:

* that you have registered as an R2lab user, and have uploaded an ssh-key
* that you have a valid reservation when you run any of these demos; this is why you need to configure the slicename that the demo code uses to access the testbed, generally with a `--slice slicename` option for command-line experiments.
